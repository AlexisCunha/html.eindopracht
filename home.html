        <h3>The Wolf</h3>
        The wolf is a large canine native to Eurasia and North America.
        More than thirty subspecies have been recognized and gray wolves, as popularly understood, comprise wild subspecies.
        The wolf is the largest extant member of the family Canidae. It is also distinguished from other Canis species by its less pointed ears and muzzle,
        as well as a shorter torso and a longer tail. Wolves are legendary because of their spine-tingling howl, which they use to communicate.
        A lone wolf howls to attract the attention of his pack, while communal howls may send territorial messages from one pack to another.
        Some howls are confrontational. Much like barking domestic dogs, 
        wolves may simply begin howling because a nearby wolf was already howling.

          <h3>Behavior</h3>
          The wolf is most specialized for cooperative game hunting as demonstrated by its physical adaptations to tackling large prey,
          its more social nature, and its highly advanced expressive behaviour.
          Wolves live and hunt in packs of around six to ten animals. They are known to roam large distances, perhaps 12 miles in a single day.
          These social animals cooperate on their preferred preyâ€”large animals such as deer, elk, and moose. When they are successful, wolves do not eat in moderation.
          A single animal can consume 20 pounds of meat at a sitting.
          Wolves also eat smaller mammals, birds, fish, lizards, snakes, and sometimes also fruit.
          Wolves are also territorial and fights over territory are among the principal causes of wolf mortality.
